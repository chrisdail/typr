# typr
This is a project I started to learn Mac OS programming and Swift. It tracks words typed per day per application and stores them to a local database with CoreData. It was inspried by the https://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy project which tracks statistics around words typed. This tracks only words typed but does not store any of the text typed.
